/*
 * Prevent the compiler from merging or refetching reads or writes. The
 * compiler is also forbidden from reordering successive instances of
 * READ_ONCE, WRITE_ONCE and ACCESS_ONCE (see below), but only when the
 * compiler is aware of some particular ordering.  One way to make the
 * compiler aware of ordering is to put the two invocations of READ_ONCE,
 * WRITE_ONCE or ACCESS_ONCE() in different C statements.
 *
 * In contrast to ACCESS_ONCE these two macros will also work on aggregate
 * data types like structs or unions. If the size of the accessed data
 * type exceeds the word size of the machine (e.g., 32 bits or 64 bits)
 * READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE()  will fall back to memcpy and print a
 * compile-time warning.
 *
 * Their two major use cases are: (1) Mediating communication between
 * process-level code and irq/NMI handlers, all running on the same CPU,
 * and (2) Ensuring that the compiler does not  fold, spindle, or otherwise
 * mutilate accesses that either do not require ordering or that interact
 * with an explicit memory barrier or atomic instruction that provides the
 * required ordering.
